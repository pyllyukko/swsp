- What?

  - A tool to keep your Slackware Linux installation up-to-date with security patches

- Why?

  - Well, when I started writing this, there just wasn't any tools to do this
  - ...Nowadays there is. But I think my tool is still needed, because it puts
    emphasis on integrity and security in general.
  - It's the only tool I use for this task. It's the only tool I trust, because
    I wrote it. And I'm not just being cocky, I'm just paranoid.

- Notes:

  - Run this manually. Always. Running something like this from cron, will
    eventually get you compromised. There will always be something that will
    fail, eventually. Do not trust automation when it comes to security.
